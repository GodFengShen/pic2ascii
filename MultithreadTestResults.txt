Analysis

On the desktop system, the fastest single threaded time was 53 seconds. The
fastest multi threaded time was 1 minute and 31 seconds. So for desktop,
single threaded is the faster method.

However, it was the opposite on the mobile system. The fastest single threaded
time was 1 minute and 46 seconds, and the fastest multi threaded time was 50
seconds.

To be clear, the desktop converting an entire 16 megapixel image. The mobile
was converting a 4x scaled 8 megapixel image.

The desktop processor has a stock speed of 1.6GHz, and a max of 1.8 across all
cores. However, a single core can "turbo" towards 3.34GHz if other cores are
not in use. If all cores are in use (in the case of multi threading), then the
cores are clocked somewhere in between 1.6 and 1.8GHZ. Combined with the
overhead of multithreading, this makes sense that single threading is faster
since this is a task where clock speed matters more than core count.

The mobile processor has a stock speed of 2.15GHz, and it can stay there across
all cores at any given time. In this way, the multi thread is faster than the
single thread; Single thread is 1 core at 2.15GHz, but multi thread is 4 cores
at 2.15GHz. The desktop was different in that it had 1 core at 3.34GHz, and 8
cores at ~1.7GHz.

In conclusion, multi threading is only worth using if the system can ensure
a high clock speed across all cores.
